wasm-loader-browsix
===================

This is an experimental implementation for a WebAssembly loader for [Browsix](https://github.com/plasma-umass/browsix), intended for use with musl, as an alternative to the [emscriten fork](https://github.com/plasma-umass/browsix-emscripten) Browsix provides.

This is only partly functional.

This is used in the emscriptenless branch of [ids1024/browsix-busybox](https://github.com/ids1024/browsix-busybox/tree/emscriptenless).
